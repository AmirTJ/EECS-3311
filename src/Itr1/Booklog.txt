1. I built the book class first.
Immediately after that we wanted to write a class for searching books, but we hadn't decided which one to use for the book collection. 
After thinking about the speed of various algorithms, we decided to use arrylist as the collection.

2. To facilitate book search, I added a new variable for book with bookId, each bookId is unique. 
Right now our group is not sure what the book's database looks like, so we don't have any ideas yet to determine if the bookId is duplicated.

3. We added a toString() method to the book class for other classes to call and visualize.
