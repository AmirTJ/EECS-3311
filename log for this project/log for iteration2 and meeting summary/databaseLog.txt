1. We started by creating four tables: Book, Bookingroom, Student account, and DevTeam account. And we added column names to each table.

2. Then we decided to put the Student account and the DevTeam account in one table to be the database.

3. Add a column in the table of books for whether the book has been borrowed or not.
