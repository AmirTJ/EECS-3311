Library Management System (LMS) 

## Description

A Library Management System (LMS) is a software application for organizing and managing a library's collection of books, periodicals, and other materials. It is used to track the circulation of materials, manage the catalog, and assist with the acquisition and cataloging of new items. An LMS typically includes features such as check-in and check-out, patron information management, and reporting tools. It can also offer integration with other systems, such as an integrated library system (ILS) or a student information system (SIS). Overall, an LMS is designed to streamline library processes and provide easy access to materials for staff and patrons.
