1.  We first created a BookSearch class

2.  Then, in order to make it easier for readers to search 
    we created a method that allows people using the system to find the book,
    whether they are searching by ID or author name or other key information.

3.  Of course, when the book is not found, our system will prompt the user,
     so that the user can check if the keyword is wrong and correct the keyword to search again.
