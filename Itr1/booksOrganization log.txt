  I build the booksOrganization class first, and we decided to use arrayList as collection. Then, I choose to write addBooks function and removeAllbooks function. 
After i finished my work, i upload it to the github website and waiting for my teammates to upload his part. The planning time for the booksOrganization class is 
three days, we actually use one and half days.
